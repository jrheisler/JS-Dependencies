# JS Dependencies Graph

This repository contains example output from a planned Dart command-line crawler
that inspects JavaScript/TypeScript projects and emits a dependency graph as a
JSON file. The included HTML file renders that graph using D3 with a force
simulation.

## Files

- `graph7.json` – sample graph output generated by the crawler.
- `graph_explorer_single_file_d_3_viewer.html` – single-page graph explorer that
  visualizes the JSON dependency data.

## Viewing the graph

Open the HTML file in a browser. It will attempt to load `jsDependencies.json`
automatically when the files are served from the same directory (e.g. using
`python -m http.server`). You can override the filename by appending
`?load=yourFile.json` (or `?graph=yourFile.json`) to the URL when serving it.
If the JSON file is unavailable, the viewer falls back to a small built-in demo
graph so the UI still renders.

You can also use the **Load graph.json** button in the header to supply any
compatible graph JSON file manually.
