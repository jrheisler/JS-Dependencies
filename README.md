# JS Dependencies Graph

This repository contains example output from a planned Dart command-line crawler
that inspects JavaScript/TypeScript projects and emits a dependency graph as a
JSON file. The included HTML file renders that graph using D3 with a force
simulation.

The `lib/` directory holds early, self-contained prototypes for crawling other
language ecosystems (Go, Java, Kotlin, Python, Rust, and JavaScript). Each
prototype scans source files, extracts import relationships, and emits a
`*Dependencies.json` file that the viewer understands.

## Files

- `graph7.json` – sample graph output generated by the crawler.
- `graph_explorer_single_file_d_3_viewer.html` – single-page graph explorer that
  visualizes the JSON dependency data.

## Viewing the graph

Open the HTML file in a browser. It will attempt to load `jsDependencies.json`
automatically when the files are served from the same directory (e.g. using
`python -m http.server`). You can override the filename by appending
`?load=yourFile.json` (or `?graph=yourFile.json`) to the URL when serving it.
If the JSON file is unavailable, the viewer falls back to a small built-in demo
graph so the UI still renders.

The prebuilt Nurox Viewer executable in `public/` ships with
`jsNuroxDependencies.json` alongside it so that the app opens with the bundled
sample graph even when launched directly from that directory.

You can also use the **Load graph.json** button in the header to supply any
compatible graph JSON file manually.

## Security scans

The JavaScript crawler (`lib/jsDependency.dart`) emits security findings when it
spots risky language features or API usage. Consult
[`docs/security_scans.md`](docs/security_scans.md) for a complete list of the
rules, severities, and trigger patterns.
